# Tesseract Demo

Read regions of interest from the frames of a video and then run them through the Tesseract OCR system.

It is assumed that you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed. All you need to do is run:

```
chmod +x run_ocr.sh
./run_ocr.sh
```

Read [this blog post](eh-dub.github.io/ocr) for more context.
